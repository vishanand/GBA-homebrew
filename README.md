GBA Homebrew Programs
=====================

This repository contains my homebrew games and programs for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance.
Although the .gba ROM files are provided, if you wish to compile these programs yourself, you must install [devkitPro](http://devkitpro.org/) ([Linux/OS X installer](https://github.com/devkitPro/installer), [Windows installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/Automated%20Installer/))
and run the `make` command.

These programs may be run on a real GBA/DS handheld with a flashcart, or through one of many emulators, such as [this one](https://github.com/endrift/gbajs) written in JavaScript.

These programs use the libgba library that is included in devkitPro and parts of [tonclib](http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm).
